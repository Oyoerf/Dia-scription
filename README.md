# Dia-scription

This program was built primarily for academic use, but whoever would need it is free to do so, as long as it respects the license.


This program has one major purpose : realising the transcription and diarization of a given audio file, for example a research interview. The output is a text file containing the retranscription, with a paragraph per speaker.
The goal was to create a program to be run on Google Colab platform, so that anyone with a Google account could leverage the power of WhisperX model (developed by Max BainÂ©).

To use this program, simply download it, open it with Google Colab and follow the instructions. Minimal to no prior coding experience is expected to use it, as the inputs are done through fields and without the need to open any code block or directly change the variables inside the program. The parameters are optimised to run long audio files (more than one hour) together with free T4 GPUs, accessible to anyone in Google Colab.

However, if you possess a premium Colab account, you are probably not afraid of small python scripts. Feel free to tweak the parameters in the first block, to optimize the performance.

Cheers !
